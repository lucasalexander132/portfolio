## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **Fraunces + Open Sans pairing** - Serif headlines (craft feel) + humanist sans body (warm, approachable)
- **OKLCH colors** - Better perceptual uniformity, Tailwind CSS 4 default
- **Dark mode only** - Single deliberate "golden hour" mood
- **Static grain** - Animated grain deferred, static works well
- **Card-level grain texture** - Applied to individual cards rather than global overlay to prevent click-blocking
- **Paper texture JPG** - Real texture image instead of SVG noise for more natural grain
- **Server component for Hero** - No interactivity needed, pure presentation
- **Client component for Nav** - Requires useState/useEffect for scroll detection
- **50px scroll threshold** - Enough scroll to indicate intent, not too sensitive
