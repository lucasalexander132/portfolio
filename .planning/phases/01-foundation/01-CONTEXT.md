# Phase 1: Foundation - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** Ready for planning

## Phase Boundary

Design system and visual infrastructure that creates the "workshop at golden hour" mood. Includes typography, color palette, texture overlay, shadow system, and responsive layout. Content, animations, and interactions are separate phases.

## Implementation Decisions

### Typography pairing
- Headlines: Refined, elegant serif with high contrast — established and trustworthy feel
- Body: Humanist sans-serif — warmer, approachable, complements the refined serif
- No specific typeface requirements — open to distinctive choices that fit the mood

### Color palette
- Dark mode only — consistent "golden hour" mood
- Amber accent: Golden honey — rich, saturated gold like late afternoon sunlight
- Base: Warm slate with blue undertones — creates interesting tension with warm accents
- Text: Warm off-white (cream/gold tint) — sinks into the page, not stark white
- Amber usage: Sparse highlights only — reserved for key CTAs and focal points

### Texture & depth
- Grain texture: Noticeable atmosphere — clearly visible, strong analog/workshop feel
- Grain style: Paper/canvas fiber texture — tactile, craft feel
- Grain coverage: Background only — cards and content areas stay clean for readability
- Shadows: Soft, diffused with cool blue tinting — gentle floating effect
- Layering: Flat with texture — elements feel on same plane, grain adds depth

### Responsive behavior
- Mobile-first approach
- Full mood intensity on mobile — same grain, shadows, warmth as desktop
- Fluid typography — text smoothly scales with viewport
- Centered max-width container on larger screens

### Claude's Discretion
- Type weight contrast (bold headlines vs regular body, or medium vs light)
- Specific typeface selection within the personality guidelines
- Grain animation (static vs subtle movement)
- Exact shadow blur radius and opacity values
- Container max-width value

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- Text should feel like it "sinks into" the page rather than sitting on top
- Cool-tinted shadows create contrast with warm golden accents
- The overall effect should feel like a craftsman's workshop lit by late afternoon sun
