# Plan 13-01: Updates Layout Chrome and ContactCTA -- Summary

Updates pages now render with the shared Navigation bar and Footer, plus a translated contact CTA linking visitors back to the homepage.

## What Was Built

Added 6 i18n keys (EN + FR) for navigation, cursor hints, CTA text, and footer links. Created a ContactCTA client component that renders a bordered card with translated heading, description, and a pill-style link button back to the homepage. Created the updates route layout wrapping all /updates pages with Navigation at top, Footer below content, and appropriate padding for the floating bottom nav.

## Deliverables

| Artifact | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| messages/en.json | Modified | Added nav.updates, cursor.latest_updates, updates.cta.*, footer.cursor.updates |
| messages/fr.json | Modified | Added matching French translations for all 6 keys |
| src/components/updates/ContactCTA.tsx | Created | Client component with translated CTA card and homepage link |
| src/app/updates/layout.tsx | Created | Server component wrapping children with Navigation + Footer |
| src/app/updates/page.tsx | Modified | Added ContactCTA below Suspense block |

## Commits

| Task | Commit | Files |
|------|--------|-------|
| Task 1: Add i18n keys and create ContactCTA | 66a8c2a | messages/en.json, messages/fr.json, src/components/updates/ContactCTA.tsx |
| Task 2: Create updates layout and wire ContactCTA | 3761230 | src/app/updates/layout.tsx, src/app/updates/page.tsx |

## Decisions Made

- Updates layout uses `pt-16 pb-32` padding to account for the fixed-position floating Navigation at bottom center (bottom: 40px) and provide breathing room at top
- ContactCTA placed outside Suspense since it has no async data dependency
- Layout is a server component; Navigation and Footer render as client components within it (they use hooks internally)

## Issues Encountered

- Stale `.next/dev/types/validator.ts` generated by the dev server caused a spurious TypeScript error about LayoutRoutes. Cleared the generated types directory; clean tsc and build both pass.
