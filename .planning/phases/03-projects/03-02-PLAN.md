<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create ProjectCard and ProjectModal components</name>
  <files>src/components/sections/ProjectCard.tsx, src/components/sections/ProjectModal.tsx</files>
  <action>
**ProjectCard.tsx** (client component):
1. Create clickable card matching Services card pattern (card-grain, bg-base-800, rounded-xl, shadow-elevation-sm)
2. Display thumbnail in aspect-video container with Next.js Image (fill + object-cover)
3. Show title (font-serif) and tagline below thumbnail
4. Add hover effects: -translate-y-1, shadow-elevation-md, scale-105 on image
5. Coming soon badge: absolute positioned pill on thumbnail (bg-base-900/90, text-amber-400, rounded-full)
6. Handle keyboard accessibility: role="button", tabIndex={0}, Enter/Space triggers click
7. Image sizes prop: `(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 50vw, 33vw`

**ProjectModal.tsx** (client component):
1. Use shadcn/ui Dialog with controlled open/onOpenChange props
2. DialogContent size="xl" (max-w-4xl, max-h-[90vh], overflow-y-auto)
3. Image gallery with useState for activeImage:
   - Main image in aspect-video container
   - Prev/Next buttons (ChevronLeft/ChevronRight from lucide-react) if images.length > 1
   - Dot indicators below image for navigation
   - Reset activeImage to 0 when project changes (useEffect with project.id dependency)
4. Case study narrative below gallery:
   - Challenge, Approach, Result sections with h3 headings (font-serif, text-amber-400)
   - Each section: heading + text-text-secondary paragraph
5. Technologies list (badges or comma-separated)
6. CTA buttons at bottom:
   - Live projects: "Visit Project" button (bg-amber-500, text-base-950) with ExternalLink icon
   - Coming soon with githubUrl: "View on GitHub" button (bg-base-700) with Github icon
   - Use isLiveProject() type guard from types
7. Gallery image sizes: `(max-width: 896px) 100vw, 896px`

Style dialog to match dark theme:
- border-base-700, bg-base-900
- Close button with ring-amber-400 focus
  </action>
  <verify>
- Both components export correctly
- `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
- Components use existing design tokens (card-grain, shadow-elevation-*, color tokens)

  <done>ProjectCard displays project preview, ProjectModal shows full case study with gallery</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create Projects section and integrate into page</name>
  <files>src/components/sections/Projects.tsx, src/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
**Projects.tsx** (client component - needs useState for modal):
1. Import projects from @/data/projects
2. State: selectedProject (Project | null)
3. Sort projects: live first, then coming-soon
4. Section structure matching Services:
   - Section with id="projects" and py-[var(--spacing-section)]
   - Container: mx-auto max-w-6xl px-[var(--container-padding)]
   - Section header: h2 "Recent Work" (text-h1, font-serif) + intro paragraph
5. Grid: gap-8 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 (matches responsive pattern)
6. Map sorted projects to ProjectCard components
7. Render ProjectModal when selectedProject is set
8. Handle modal close by setting selectedProject to null

**page.tsx** updates:
1. Import Projects from @/components/sections/Projects
2. Add <Projects /> after <Services /> in main

Section intro copy suggestion:
"Real projects, real results. Click any project to see the full story."
  </action>
  <verify>
- Projects section renders below Services on main page
- Grid is responsive (1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 col desktop)
- Clicking card opens modal, clicking outside/Escape/X closes it
- `npm run build` succeeds
  </verify>
  <done>Projects section integrated into main page with working card grid and modal</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
Complete projects section with:
- Responsive card grid (3 columns desktop, 2 tablet, 1 mobile)
- Project cards with thumbnails, titles, taglines, hover effects
- "Coming Soon" badge on coming-soon projects
- Modal with image gallery (prev/next navigation, dot indicators)
- Case study narrative (Challenge > Approach > Result)
- "Visit Project" button for live projects
- "View on GitHub" button for coming-soon projects with repo links
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Visit http://localhost:3000 (dev server should be running)
2. Scroll to Projects section below Services
3. Verify card grid:
   - Desktop (1024px+): 3 columns
   - Tablet (640-1023px): 2 columns
   - Mobile (<640px): 1 column
4. Test card hover: subtle lift animation, image scale
5. Click a live project card:
   - Modal opens with gallery
   - Try prev/next navigation (if multiple images)
   - Challenge/Approach/Result sections visible
   - "Visit Project" button present
   - Press Escape or click X to close
6. Click a coming-soon project card:
   - "Coming Soon" badge visible on card
   - Modal shows available info
   - "View on GitHub" button (if repo link exists)
7. Verify modal closes on:
   - X button click
   - Backdrop click
   - Escape key
8. Check visual consistency with Services cards (same shadow, grain texture, spacing)

Note: Images will be placeholder/broken since actual screenshots not yet added.
Focus on layout, interactions, and text content.

1. `npm run build` - Production build succeeds
2. Projects section visible on homepage below Services
3. Card grid responsive across breakpoints
4. Modal opens/closes with proper accessibility (focus trap, Escape key)
5. Live vs coming-soon projects display correct CTAs
6. At least one project shows quantified result in case study

- PROJ-02: Case studies follow Challenge > Approach > Result narrative
- PROJ-03: Quantified outcomes visible (from data created in Plan 01)
- PROJ-04: Templated system - adding projects only requires data file changes
- All modal accessibility features working (focus trap, Escape, backdrop click)
- Visual consistency with existing design system
