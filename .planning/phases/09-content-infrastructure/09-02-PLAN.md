<objective>
Create 4 seed markdown entries covering different tags and verify the entire pipeline end-to-end with a successful build.

Purpose: Seed content validates that the parsing pipeline, frontmatter validation, tag type checking, and "use cache" caching all work together. Without real entries, the pipeline is untested.
Output: 4 markdown files in src/content/updates/ and a passing build.

Create the directory `src/content/updates/` and add 4 markdown files. Each file must have YAML frontmatter with exactly these fields: title (string), date (YYYY-MM format), tag (one of the UPDATE_TAGS values), summary (string). The markdown body should be 2-4 paragraphs written in Lucas's voice -- conversational, reflective, focused on craft and learning.

**File 1: `2025-06-codex-grove-launch.md`**
- title: "Codex Grove Launches in Beta"
- date: "2025-06"
- tag: "project-launch"
- summary: "After months of development, Codex Grove enters public beta with AI-powered documentation and Kanban task management."
- Body: 2-3 paragraphs about the journey from concept to beta, scope discipline, shipping something real. Conversational tone.

**File 2: `2025-09-design-system-thinking.md`**
- title: "Why I Build Design Systems First"
- date: "2025-09"
- tag: "design-thinking"
- summary: "A reflection on how starting with typography, color, and spacing decisions saves weeks of rework downstream."
- Body: 2-3 paragraphs about the value of design systems for small teams and solo developers.

**File 3: `2025-11-community-workshop.md`**
- title: "Running My First Workshop"
- date: "2025-11"
- tag: "community"
- summary: "Teaching local business owners the basics of web presence at a community center changed how I think about my work."
- Body: 2-3 paragraphs about the experience and what was learned.

**File 4: `2026-01-learning-rust.md`**
- title: "Picking Up Rust on the Side"
- date: "2026-01"
- tag: "learning"
- summary: "Exploring Rust for CLI tooling has been humbling and rewarding in equal measure."
- Body: 2-3 paragraphs about learning a systems language as a frontend developer.

Each entry MUST:
- Use exact YAML frontmatter format with `---` delimiters
- Have the date in YYYY-MM format (no day)
- Use a tag that exists in UPDATE_TAGS
- Have a non-empty summary
- Have at least 2 paragraphs of markdown body content

Do NOT include any MDX/JSX in the markdown body -- plain markdown only.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - All 4 files exist in src/content/updates/
    - Each file has valid YAML frontmatter between --- delimiters
    - Tags used: project-launch, design-thinking, community, learning (4 different tags)
    - Dates are in YYYY-MM format
  </verify>
  <done>4 seed entries exist with valid frontmatter covering 4 different tags</done>

  <name>Task 2: Verify pipeline end-to-end with build</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
1. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify TypeScript compilation passes with the seed entries and pipeline code.

2. Create a temporary verification script to test the pipeline at runtime (since getUpdates reads from disk, we need to actually call it):
   ```
   node --experimental-strip-types -e "
     import { getUpdates } from './src/lib/updates.ts';
     // We can't easily test 'use cache' outside Next.js, but we can verify parsing works
   "
   ```

   If the above doesn't work due to "use cache" or cacheLife import issues outside Next.js context, instead verify by running `npm run build`. The build will:
   - Compile all TypeScript (catching type errors)
   - Execute server components (catching runtime parsing errors)
   - Fail if any frontmatter validation throws

3. Run `npm run build` and confirm it succeeds with exit code 0.

If the build fails:
- Check error output for frontmatter validation errors (fix the seed entry)
- Check for TypeScript errors (fix the type)
- Check for import errors (fix the import path or package)

IMPORTANT: The build is the authoritative end-to-end test. TypeScript compilation alone does not test the runtime parsing.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `npm run build` exits with code 0
    - No TypeScript errors in build output
    - No runtime errors related to content parsing in build output
  </verify>
  <done>
    - npm run build succeeds
    - The pipeline correctly parses all 4 seed entries (no validation errors)
    - TypeScript compilation passes (tag vocabulary and UpdateEntry interface enforced)
    - Phase 9 success criteria fully met: typed pipeline exists, schema enforced at build time, 4 seed entries validated
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npm run build` succeeds (exit code 0)
- 4 markdown files exist in src/content/updates/
- Each file uses a different tag from UPDATE_TAGS
- Entries would be returned newest-first (2026-01, 2025-11, 2025-09, 2025-06)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
The full content pipeline works end-to-end: markdown files on disk are parsed into typed UpdateEntry objects, frontmatter is validated, markdown body is rendered to HTML, and the build succeeds. Phase 9 is complete.
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/09-content-infrastructure/09-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
