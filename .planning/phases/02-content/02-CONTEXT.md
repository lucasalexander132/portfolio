# Phase 2: Content - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Hero and services sections with empathy-first messaging that acknowledges visitor wariness and clearly states value. Users should feel trust and want to scroll to see work. Projects section, animations, and contact form are separate phases.

## Implementation Decisions

### Hero Messaging & Tone
- **Primary action:** Get visitors to scroll and see work (not immediate conversion)
- **Audience:** Small business owner burned by developers before — skeptical but needs help
- **Customer voice:** "I don't want to get ripped off" — value anxiety dominates their thinking
- **Differentiation:** "I actually communicate" — regular updates, responsive, no ghosting
- **Desired feeling:** Trust (quiet confidence, not salesy)
- **Voice:** Thoughtful partner — collaborative tone, "Let's figure this out together"
- **Value proposition:** Both layered — relationship hook first, then specific capability
- **Personality:** Warm professional — approachable but business-appropriate

### Hero Visual Composition
- **Visual focus:** Atmospheric texture — grain/gradient backdrop creates the workshop feel, text floats on it
- **Height:** ~80-90vh — hint of content below to encourage scrolling
- **Text layout:** Left-aligned with breathing room on right
- **Hero CTA:** Subtle text link ("See my work ↓" or similar) — gentle nudge, no pressure
- **Animation:** Static for now — animation added in Phase 4
- **Navigation:** Floating nav bar — transparent overlay on hero, becomes solid on scroll
- **Nav content:** Logo + section anchor links (Services, Projects, Contact)
- **Section transition:** Subtle divider — gradient fade, line, or soft spacing between hero and services
- **Mobile behavior:** Reflow — adapt layout specifically for mobile, not just scale down
- **Identity placement:** In nav only — hero focuses entirely on message
- **Scroll hint:** Simple text with arrow character — no animation yet

### Services Presentation
- **Service count:** 3 services — classic trio, easy to scan
- **Layout:** Cards in a row — 3 equal cards side by side, stacked on mobile
- **Card content:** Title + short description — headline and 1-2 sentences, minimal
- **Card visuals:** Simple icons — one per service for quick scanning
- **Interactivity:** Static for Phase 2 — hover/interaction added in Phase 4

### Content Hierarchy & Scanning
- **First impression:** Atmosphere — mood/texture registers before text
- **Type scale:** Dramatic contrast — very large headlines, notably smaller body text
- **Services section header:** Empathy-driven — something like "How I Can Help" (outcome focused)
- **Header style:** Headers only — clean, minimal, no subheads needed

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact copy for headline, subhead, and service descriptions (informed by these decisions)
- Specific icon choices for services
- Exact spacing and padding values
- Mobile breakpoint specifics for reflow
- Nav link order and exact labels

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- Copywriting should follow: clarity over cleverness, benefits over features, specificity over vagueness
- Headline formulas to consider: "{Achieve outcome} without {pain point}" or question highlighting pain
- The "thoughtful partner" voice means collaborative language, not chest-thumping
- Service descriptions should focus on what visitor receives, not technical capabilities
