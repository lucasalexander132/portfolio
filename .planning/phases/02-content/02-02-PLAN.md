<objective>
Complete the Content phase by creating the Services section and composing all components into the main page.

Purpose: Services section presents what visitors receive in scannable format with outcome-focused messaging. The complete page flow (nav -> hero -> services) establishes trust before asking for anything.
Output: Working single-page with navigation, hero, and services sections ready for visual verification.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Services section</name>
  <files>src/components/sections/Services.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Create a server component with three service cards:

    1. Section structure:
       - section element with id="services" (for anchor navigation from hero)
       - py-[var(--spacing-section)] for consistent vertical rhythm
       - Max width 6xl container with container padding

    2. Section header:
       - h2: "How I Can Help" (text-h1 font-serif text-text-primary mb-4)
       - Intro paragraph: "Every project starts with a conversation — no pressure, no commitment. Just two people figuring out if we're a good fit."
         (text-body text-text-secondary max-w-2xl mb-12)

    3. Service cards array (define at top of file):
       ```typescript
       const services = [
         {
           icon: Code,
           title: "Custom Development",
           description: "If you're tired of templates that don't fit, I build exactly what your business needs — no more, no less."
         },
         {
           icon: MessageSquare,
           title: "Ongoing Communication",
           description: "If you've been ghosted before, you'll appreciate weekly updates and responses within hours, not days."
         },
         {
           icon: Zap,
           title: "Fast Iteration",
           description: "If you're watching competitors move faster, I help you ship improvements in days instead of months."
         }
       ]
       ```

    4. Card layout:
       - grid gap-8 md:grid-cols-3 (three columns on md+, stacked on mobile)

    5. Card styling:
       - article element for semantic markup
       - card-grain class for paper texture
       - p-8 bg-base-800 rounded-xl shadow-elevation-sm
       - Icon: text-amber-500 mb-6, size={32} strokeWidth={1.5}
       - Title: text-h3 font-serif text-text-primary mb-3
       - Description: text-body text-text-secondary leading-relaxed

    Import icons from lucide-react: Code, MessageSquare, Zap
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `src/components/sections/Services.tsx` exists
    - Contains import from lucide-react
    - Contains three service cards with Code, MessageSquare, Zap icons
    - Uses grid md:grid-cols-3 for responsive layout
    - Section has id="services"
  </verify>
  <done>Services section displays three cards with icons and outcome-focused copy in responsive grid</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Compose main page</name>
  <files>src/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Replace the Phase 1 test page with the actual portfolio content:

    1. Remove "use client" directive — page is now a server component
    2. Remove all test content (typography showcase, button variations, etc.)

    3. Import components:
       - Navigation from "@/components/layout/Navigation"
       - Hero from "@/components/sections/Hero"
       - Services from "@/components/sections/Services"

    4. Page structure:
       ```tsx
       export default function Home() {
         return (
           <>
             <Navigation />
             <main>
               <Hero />
               <Services />
             </main>
           </>
         )
       }
       ```

    5. Add smooth scrolling to html element:
       - Add to globals.css: `html { scroll-behavior: smooth; }`
       - This enables smooth scrolling for anchor links

    Note: Navigation is outside main since it's fixed position. Hero and Services are semantic content.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `src/app/page.tsx` does NOT contain "use client"
    - Imports Navigation, Hero, Services
    - Renders components in correct order
    - Test page content is removed
    - globals.css has scroll-behavior: smooth
  </verify>
  <done>Main page composes navigation, hero, and services into cohesive single-page experience</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
    Complete Content phase: Navigation bar, Hero section with empathy-first messaging, Services section with three outcome-focused cards.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run `npm run dev` and visit http://localhost:3000

    2. Verify Navigation:
       - Logo "Civix" visible in top-left
       - Links (Services, Projects, Contact) visible in top-right
       - Scroll down — nav should transition from transparent to solid background with shadow
       - Scroll back up — nav should return to transparent

    3. Verify Hero:
       - Empathy headline visible: "Been burned by developers before?"
       - Supporting text visible below headline
       - Atmospheric gradient/glow creates warm workshop mood
       - "See how I can help" scroll hint visible with arrow
       - Click scroll hint — should smooth-scroll to Services section

    4. Verify Services:
       - Section header "How I Can Help" visible
       - Three cards in a row (on desktop)
       - Each card has icon, title, and description
       - Cards have grain texture and subtle shadow
       - Resize to mobile width — cards should stack vertically

    5. Overall feel:
       - Does the page feel warm and welcoming, not corporate?
       - Does the messaging acknowledge visitor skepticism?
       - Does it feel like "workshop at golden hour"?
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" to proceed, or describe any issues to fix</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After all tasks complete and checkpoint passes:
1. All components render without errors
2. TypeScript compilation passes: `npx tsc --noEmit`
3. Smooth scrolling works from hero to services
4. Responsive layout works (desktop 3-col, mobile stacked)
5. Navigation scroll transition works
6. Visual mood matches "workshop at golden hour" intent
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Services section uses problem/solution format per SERV-01
- Descriptions focus on outcomes per SERV-02
- Layout is scannable per SERV-03
- Hero acknowledges wariness per HERO-01
- Value prop is above fold per HERO-02
- Atmospheric mood per HERO-03
- Human verifies visual implementation matches intent
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/02-content/02-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
