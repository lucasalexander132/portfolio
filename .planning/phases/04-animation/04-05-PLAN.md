<objective>
Verify all animation work through human testing and reduced-motion accessibility check.

Purpose: Animation is experiential - automated tests can't verify "smooth & measured" feeling. Human eyes confirm the motion personality matches intent.

Output: Verified animation phase with user approval

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
Complete animation system for portfolio:
1. Hero with typewriter headline and orchestrated content reveal
2. Scroll-triggered reveals for Services and Projects sections
3. Spring hover on project cards, sliding underline on nav links
4. Inline project detail expansion with draggable gallery carousel
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Page Load Animation:**
1. Hard refresh the page (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Verify: Nav is visible immediately
3. Verify: Hero photo is visible immediately
4. Verify: Headline types out character by character (~3 seconds total)
5. Verify: Cursor blinks during typing
6. Verify: After headline completes, cursor blinks a few times then fades
7. Verify: Subtext and CTA fade-up together after headline finishes

**Scroll Animations:**
1. Scroll down past the hero
2. Verify: Services section fades up when ~25% visible
3. Verify: Service cards stagger in sequence (not all at once)
4. Verify: Projects section fades up similarly
5. Verify: Scroll back up - animations don't re-trigger

**Interactive States:**
1. Hover over a project card
2. Verify: Card lifts up with subtle spring (not bouncy)
3. Click/tap a project card
4. Verify: Card scales down slightly on press
5. Hover over nav links (Services, Projects)
6. Verify: Underline slides in from left
7. Click Contact button
8. Verify: Button scales down on press

**Project Detail Expansion:**
1. Click a project card
2. Verify: Section expands below cards with height animation
3. Verify: Content wipes in from right after height settles
4. Verify: Cards section bottom corners round when detail opens
5. Verify: Gallery is draggable horizontally with momentum
6. Verify: Gallery images bleed outside the content frame
7. Click a different project card
8. Verify: Content cross-fades (section stays open)
9. Click close (X) button
10. Verify: Section collapses with reverse animation

**Reduced Motion (Accessibility):**
1. Enable reduced motion in system settings:
   - Mac: System Preferences > Accessibility > Display > Reduce motion
   - Chrome DevTools: Rendering > Emulate CSS prefers-reduced-motion: reduce
2. Hard refresh the page
3. Verify: Typewriter still works (text-based, not vestibular)
4. Verify: Fade opacity animations still work (safe for vestibular)
5. Verify: No sliding/bouncing/spring animations (y transforms disabled)
6. Re-disable reduced motion when done

**Overall Feel:**
- Does it feel "smooth & measured" (calm confidence)?
- Is there excessive bounce or frantic energy? (should be none)
- Does the motion enhance or distract from content?
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all animations work as intended, or describe specific issues found</resume-signal>

User has manually verified all animation behaviors and confirmed they match the intended "smooth & measured" motion personality.

<success_criteria>
- Page load choreography works: nav immediate, photo immediate, headline typewriter, subtext/CTA after
- Scroll reveals work at 25% visibility with stagger
- Interactive states work: card hover, button press, nav underline
- Inline expansion works: height animate, content wipe, cross-fade, draggable gallery
- Reduced motion support works: transforms disabled, opacity preserved
- User approves overall animation feel
</success_criteria>
