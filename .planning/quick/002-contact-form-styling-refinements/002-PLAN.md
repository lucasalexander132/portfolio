# Quick Plan 002: Contact Form Styling Refinements

## Goal

Restyle the contact form with slower animation, cream background, modal card appearance, centered positioning, and responsive sizing.

## Tasks

1. **Update ContactForm animation and styling**
   - Change from slide-down to slide-up animation
   - Use springSubtle for slower feel
   - Add backdrop overlay
   - Cream background with dark text
   - Modal card shape (rounded, shadow)
   - ~33% width on desktop, margins on mobile
   - Center horizontally and vertically

2. **Update Navigation transition**
   - Use springSubtle for consistency with form
