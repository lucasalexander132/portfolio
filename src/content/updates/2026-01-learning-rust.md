summary: "Exploring Rust for CLI tooling has been humbling and rewarding in equal measure."

I have been writing TypeScript professionally for years, so picking up Rust felt like going from driving an automatic to rebuilding a manual transmission. The borrow checker does not care about your feelings. It does not care that your code "should work." It demands that you prove it, and that is simultaneously the most frustrating and most educational experience I have had as a developer in a long time.

My goal is not to become a Rust developer -- it is to build better CLI tools. Node.js scripts work fine for small tasks, but they are slow to start and awkward to distribute. A compiled Rust binary starts instantly, ships as a single file, and handles errors in ways that feel deliberate rather than accidental. For developer tooling, that matters.

The real takeaway so far is not about Rust specifically. It is about the value of being a beginner again. When everything is unfamiliar, you pay attention to things you normally skip over. You read error messages carefully. You actually check the documentation instead of guessing. I think every developer should periodically pick up something that makes them feel a little lost. It keeps the craft honest.
