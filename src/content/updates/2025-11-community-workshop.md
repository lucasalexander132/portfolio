A friend who runs a community center asked if I could do a short session on "getting your business online." I said yes before I really thought about what that meant. The audience was not developers or designers -- it was a florist, a barber, a woman who runs a catering business out of her kitchen. They did not care about frameworks or hosting providers. They wanted to know if people could find them on Google.

That shift in perspective hit me harder than I expected. I spend most of my time thinking about code quality, performance budgets, and component architecture. None of that matters if the person across the table just wants their phone number to show up when someone searches for "birthday cakes near me." It was a good reminder that the work I do is supposed to serve real people with real problems.

I left that workshop wanting to do more of this kind of thing. Not because it is good for business, though it probably is, but because it reconnected me with why I got into this work in the first place. Technology is only valuable when it helps someone do something they could not do before.
