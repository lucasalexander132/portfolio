summary: "After months of development, Codex Grove enters public beta with AI-powered documentation and Kanban task management."

Codex Grove started as a side project born out of frustration. I was juggling documentation across Notion, Google Docs, and scattered markdown files, and none of it talked to each other. The idea was simple: what if your docs could understand your codebase, and your task board could understand your docs? That question turned into months of late nights and weekends.

The hardest part was not building the features -- it was deciding which features to cut. Early prototypes had real-time collaboration, a plugin system, and an AI chat interface. I shipped with none of those. What I shipped instead was a focused tool that does two things well: AI-assisted documentation generation and a Kanban board that links tasks directly to the files they touch. Scope discipline is hard, but shipping something real is better than perfecting something imaginary.

Going public with a beta still feels vulnerable. There are rough edges I can see from a mile away, and I know users will find ones I missed. But the feedback loop is already teaching me more than another month of solo development ever could. That is the whole point.
